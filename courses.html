    <h2>Histoty of python </h2>
    <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
    <h2>Evolution of Python</h2>
    <p>The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types of exception handling and functions.
